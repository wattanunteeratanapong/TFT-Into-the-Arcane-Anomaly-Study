# TFT-Set-13-Anomaly-Study
Have you ever wonder how many time do we have to roll until we found the anomaly that we're looking for in TFT Set13? <br><br>

## Overview
In this experiment we gonna test both patch 14.23 and 14.24 <br>
The different between these patch anomaly system is <br>
Patch 14.23 : The anomaly that have already been roll are not gonna appear again in the pool <br>
Patch 14.24 : The anomaly that have already been roll might be able to appear again in the pool <br>
If we compare this to the Probability Patch 14.23 would be Dependent Trail, and Patch 14.24 would be Independent Trial <br>
<br>


## Hypothesis
### Patch 14.23
"Hypergeometric Random Variable" (Dependent Trial) <br>
P(K N) is a probability of success k time in n trial (order doesn't matter) <br>
P(K N) = KCk × (N-K)C(n-k) / NCn <br>
P(1 40) = 40C1 ()  <br>

### Patch 14.23
"Binomial Random Variable" (Independent Trial) <br>
P(k n) is a probability of success k time in n trial (order doesn't matter) <br>
P(k n) = nCk × pᵏ × (1-p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ <br>
P(0,100) <br>
